# Bubble-Shooter-Game
We called the bubbles "baubles" for some reason, also this was on the TM4C123 board. 

Interfaced with switches, slide potentiometer, LCD screen, used DAC for sound, used bitmaps for images in-game, utilized several timer interrupts, and such.

Code is a mess, but it works. And yes we never renamed the SpaceInvaders file.
