# Bubble-Shooter-Game
We called the bubbles "baubles" for some reason, also this was on the TM4C123 board.

Interfaced with switches, slide potentiometer, LCD screen, used DAC for sound, used bitmaps for images in-game, utilized several timer interrupts, and such.

Code is a mess, but it works. Some functions could be optimized to be far shorter.

And yes, we never renamed the SpaceInvaders file.

High scores couldn't be retained unfortunately due to volatile memory, but it was fun to implement and we only needed it to last for one session anyway.
